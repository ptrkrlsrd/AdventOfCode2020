# AdventOfCode2020

## Day 01 - https://nim-lang.org/
* Did I like it? Yeah, kind of. At times it felt like Python with even more syntax sugar than the newest versions of Python.
## Day 02 - https://www.scala-lang.org/
* Did I like it? I initially tried this challenge using Lua, but quickly figured out Lua wasn't for me. I saw Scala as a good choice for this task from what I'd seen and I was right! There's a lot to the code I know can be simplified. For example the initialization of variables from the regex groups. I hate how slow it compiles and that it outputs jar-files.
## Day 03 - https://fsharp.org/
* Did I like it? I liked it quite a lot. If I had the opportunity to use it instead of C# at work, I'd easily do it.
## Day 04 - https://www.python.org/
* My first approach was to use regex to validate the passports. 
* Did I like it? Using Python3.9 for this task really made me miss my old Python days. Writing the code was a breeze! I hadn't used the `scheme`library before but it's way nicer than using dang if-tests to validate code.
